      Our designers take on a variety of different kinds of requests to support 
      the student and local community. We build our portfolios by providing flyers, 
      banners, logos, and more pro-bono for on-campus clubs. We also take on larger 
      branding projects from local businesses and startups with our advanced design 
      team.

      Our photographers document the happenings of the campus and the city. We 
      work on client requests such as event photography, portraiture, or studio 
      and product photography, as well as providing ample space for our photographers 
      to explore their aesthetic on their own through personal projects.
